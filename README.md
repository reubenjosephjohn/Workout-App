# My Personal Project

This is a desktop application that will help its users to maintain their fitness goals. It will help
to keep track of your favorite workouts ,and it will help to seperate all the workouts belonging to a particular
category. The users can also set daily goals for
themselves which will motivate them to complete their 
workouts
and help them track their progress.

I am highly interested in fitness and love to spend my free time working out.
I believe creating such an application would allow folks
like me to acheive our fitness goals and stay motivated to
remaining fit.
